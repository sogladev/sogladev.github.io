# Git-Based Addon Manager

A modern GUI addon manager that uses Git repositories to install, update, and manage World of Warcraft addons across multiple installations.

## Why I Built It

I started this project as a way to explore building a real desktop application with the following constraints:

- **Rust-first core** with strong typing and safety
- **Tauri** for a lightweight, cross-platform shell
- **Vue.js + DaisyUI** for a pleasant, testable UI

At the same time, I had a concrete pain point: keeping the same set of addons up to date across multiple WoW clients and installs. Existing managers either did not support Git-based workflows well or were too tied to a single ecosystem. This project became a way to:

- Treat addons as **versioned Git repos** instead of opaque downloads
- **Sync addons across multiple addon directories** (e.g., different clients / installs)
- Experiment with **end-to-end tooling**: Rust backend, Vue frontend, tests, and CI

Over time, what started as a Tauri experiment turned into a practical tool I actually use.

## Key Features

- **Git-based installs**: Install addons directly from GitHub/GitLab URLs
- **Curated catalogue**: Built-in list of popular addons for quick install without hunting for URLs
- **Bulk operations**: Install or update all tracked addons in one action
- **Multiple addon directories**: Manage several WoW installs from a single UI
- **Local addon support**: Install from local folders and keep non-Git addons managed via symlinks
- **Branch and sub-addon management**: Switch Git branches and handle nested addon structures
- **Headless CLI mode**: Run in `--headless` mode to check and update addons without opening the UI
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

For full details, screenshots, and usage examples, see the project README on GitHub.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** for the core logic and CLI
- **Tauri** as the desktop application shell
- **Vue.js** for the frontend
- **DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS** for styling and components
- **Bun** for frontend tooling and scripts
- **Testing & tooling**: Rust tests, ESLint/Prettier, and git hooks for formatting

## What I Learned

- How to structure a **Rust + Tauri + Vue** codebase cleanly between backend and frontend
- Managing **cross-platform filesystem quirks** (symlinks, paths, and permissions) for addon directories
- Designing a UI that stays simple while still exposing advanced flows like local imports and headless updates
