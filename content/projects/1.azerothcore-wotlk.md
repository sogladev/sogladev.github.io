# AzerothCore-WotLK Maintainer

[AzerothCore-WotLK](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) is a large, long-lived C++ codebase that powers many Wrath of the Lich King private servers.

My role has evolved from individual bugfixes into ongoing **core development and maintenance**, working across gameplay systems, scripts, and database content.

## Role & Scope

- Contribute and review changes to **core C++ systems** (players, spells, conditions, LFG, reputation, etc.)
- Fix and refine **encounter scripts** and world content (Northrend quests, Naxxramas details, SmartAI behavior)
- Adjust and validate **database data** (spell groups, stacking rules, loot, conditions)
- Participate in the **day-to-day maintenance** of an active open source MMO project: code review, regression checks, and documentation updates

## What I Worked On

- **Spell queue**
  Implemented a **server-side spell queue** for players, using client reverse-engineering (IDA) to mirror blizzlike feel while staying careful about fast, back-to-back rotations.

- **Combat & systems fixes**
  Improve edge cases in reputation, aura removal, conditions, and spell stacking to match retail behavior as closely as possible.

- **Dungeon Finder & rewards**
  Refine how LFG bonuses and special rewards (like The Oculus cache) are granted, ensuring they only trigger under the correct matchmaking conditions.

- **Spells and auras**
  Tune spell groups and stacking rules (e.g. Power Infusion + haste effects, Faerie Fire variants) using a mix of theorycraft sources and retail/Wrath references.

- **Scripts & world polish**
  Fix softlocks and missing behaviors in Northrend questlines and raid encounters (e.g. Valhalas events, Naxxramas details such as Thaddius intros and ambience).

## What I Learned

Working on AzerothCore has been a crash course in maintaining a serious C++ project in production:

- **Deep C++ in a legacy codebase**
  Navigating large inheritance hierarchies (`Unit`, `Player`, spells, auras) and making changes that don’t break other subsystems.

- **CMake, builds, and CI**
  Keeping cross-platform builds healthy, understanding how the CMake configuration, modules, and CI matrix interact.

- **Debugging at scale**
  Using logs, assertions, and in-game reproduction to track down subtle bugs that only appear under specific combat or LFG scenarios.

- **Data + code together**
  Treating SQL, SmartAI, and spell groups as first-class citizens and reasoning about how they interact with C++ logic.

- **Community-driven development**
  Working within review, testing, and wiki processes so that changes are understandable, testable, and maintainable for other contributors.
