# AzerothCore Post-Install Setup

This page collects practical post-install notes and snippets for AzerothCore. Use it to quickly get a test environment ready: useful `worldserver.conf` values, account and character provisioning, recommended client addons, and workflows for managing multiple clients.


## worldserver.conf

Helpful `worldserver.conf` snippets to simplify testing and troubleshooting:

`worldserver.conf`

```ini
# Paths
DataDir=
LogsDir=

# Logging / packet capture
PacketLogFile = "world.pkt"

# Gameplay / economy tweaks (testing)
StartPlayerMoney = 1000000000
StartHeroicPlayerMoney = 1000000000

# Instance / group tweaks (testing)
Group.Raid.LevelRestriction = 1
Instance.IgnoreRaid = 1
AllowTwoSide.Interaction.* = 1
```

## Account setup

A small set of convenience accounts makes testing faster. I use short, easy logins for admins and a simple player account:

```zsh
account create q q
account set gmlevel q 3 -1
```

Example convention: admin accounts `q/q`, `w/w`, `e/e`, `r/r`, `t/t` and a player `p/p` for quick logins.

## Character creation

- Use `.pdump` to export/import characters between servers or cores.
- Prefer fresh test characters for isolated checks, or import a template when useful.

Helpful modules for quickly provisioning characters:

- PTR template: https://github.com/heyitsbench/mod-ptr-template
- Skip DK starting area: https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-skip-dk-starting-area
- NPC talent template: https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-npc-talent-template

## Useful client addons

- AnyIDTooltip: https://github.com/Raynbock/AtlaslootProjectEpoch/tree/main/AnyIDTooltip: shows IDs in tooltips.
- TrainAllButton: https://github.com/sogladev/addon-335-train-all-button: adds a "train all" button to trainers.

## Client / realm switching

Manage multiple clients and realmlists efficiently with workspace-based utilities. For example `rs-realmctl` lets you define named client workspaces, set `realmlist`, and launch specific client configs (aliases like `WOWL`, `WOWL2`, `WOWC`). It reduces disk usage by creating client workspaces from a stock client.

## Addon manager

Git-based addon manager for installing, updating, and symlinking addons per client workspace:

Useful for keeping addon sets in sync across client workspaces and simplifying installs/uninstalls per client.
